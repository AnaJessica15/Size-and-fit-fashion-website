# She_Code: Size-and-fit

## OBJECTIVES

On developing our initial ideas, we would like to achieve a realistic and true solution for the problem ‘Size and Fit’ faced by women in online shopping using Artificial Intelligence. Thus we have proposed two solutions: * 3D try-on technology * 'My Stylist' app

We would like to come up with an complimentary app called 'My Stylist' app to assist the customer's required style and fashion and obtain 100% customer satisfaction.

The idea of 3D try-on was inspired by the DITTO technology which is used to analyze facial features. The triMirror is the world’s first real-time cloth simulation and multi-platform 3D virtual fitting solution. This 3D virtual fitting technology is uncompromising as for it is accurate, real-time, 3D visualized, animated, entertaining, and valuable to both shoppers and brands.

## IMPLEMENTATION

The 3D try-on solution is a real-time virtual try-on system that enables consumers and designers to experience real-life clothes on their accurate virtual models in motion, as well as the instant fit visualization on online, desktop, or mobile platforms. We have designed a 3d human figure as our prototype. This prototype can be implemented into a website to initiate 3D try-on. The link is attached in our GitHub page.

Within the given time, we have tried our best to create a fashion website which includes Home page, Women's section and Purchase cart section. The respective coding in included in our GitHub page.

The 'My Stylist' app is developed to work as a virtual fitting room so shoppers can try on clothes prior to purchase. This app would need access to personal data in order to act as a personal stylist and produce images of shoppers wearing outfits they are considering to purchase. We have designed the prototype of our app and the images are included here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqffcG_jrSitlq-ihRjtIYbPGVkVk80B/view?usp=sharing

## SCOPE

Fashion designers, animators, game developers, and 3D artists can easily create 3D clothes from 2D patterns and can see how they fit and move in real-time, with different fabrics and colors, and on different body sizes and shapes. Thus this 3D try-on can be further developed by digitalizing clothing items and trying them on personalized avatars of the customer.

The online fashion retailers can easily integrate the 3D try-on technology as a virtual fitting and dressing into e-commerce web platform

The 'My Stylist' app that works as a virtual fitting room helps shoppers to try on clothes prior to their purchase. We have created the template of the 'My Stylist' app which is included in our video.

## CONCLUSION 

Thus we strongly believe that our solutions would enhance the virtual shopping experience for the customers and would help women to find the style, fabric, pattern and the material that best suits her body shape and size make her feel confident in her own self.
